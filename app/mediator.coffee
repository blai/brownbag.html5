# Mediator singleton
# ------------------

# The mediator is a simple object all others modules use to
# communicate with each other. It implements the Publish/Subscribe pattern.
#
# Additionally, it holds two common objects which need to be shared
# between modules: the user and the router.
#
# This module returns the mediator singleton object. This is the
# application-wide mediator you might load into modules
# which need to talk to other modules using Publish/Subscribe.
#
# The actual creation of the mediator takes place in another
# module, see chaplin/lib/create_mediator.coffee.

# Create the mediator using Chaplinâ€™s constructor,
# add properties/methods for getting/setting the user and the router
module.exports = mediator = createMediator
  createRouterProperty: true
  createUserProperty: true

# You might add properties to the mediator here
